# Python-M2-QEA
Final project for the python crash course M2 QEA

Python crash course project on bank churn rate
See https://smellydatascience.com/teaching/python-for-data-science/evaluation for the data (dataset1)

Context
A european bank wants to identify the main factors contributing to customer churn (i.e., customers leaving the bank and closing their accounts). 
By doing so, the bank can target such customers with incentives, or use this knowledge to propose new products that are better suited to their needs.

Questions:
- What is the churn rate among the bank's customers?
- How are the different variables (gender, age, geography, etc.) distributed in the dataset?
- How do the different variables interact with each other?
- What are the age, salary, balance, number of products, etc. distributions for each gender group?
- How are different indicators distributed by country?etc.
- How do the different variables affect churn? What are the causes that can lead to increased (or reduced) customer churn?
- (Optional) Build a simple machine learning classification model that predicts churn based on a customer's features.
